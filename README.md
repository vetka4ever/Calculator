So, if i understood right, it is call pet-project
I was trying write this with MVP pattern and without storydoards
Yeah, it is harder, but i like it: my project divided on 3 part & if i wiil get mistake i will know what part of project is broken: model, view or presenter.
What new experience i got:
 - Writing without storyboards
 - Writing with programming's pattern
 - Understood how place UI element's programmly
 - UILabel have bool value wich tell label should ignore user events or not & if you not changed this value on true no one events won't work how you think & wantðŸ˜¡
